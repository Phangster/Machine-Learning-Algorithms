# Machine Learning Algorithms in Python
**Author:** Stephen Tse \<***@cmu.edu\>

A repository for hosting some of the popular machine learning algorithm implementations.

**This is an academic project.** Please use [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) instead for general, production-ready implementations.


## Language & Dependencies

**Language:** Python 2.7 / 3.6

**Dependency Restriction:** only `numpy`, `scipy` and Python's built-in libraries (unfortunately `pandas` is not supported in grading VMs)


## Algorithm List (Ongoing)

1. Decision Tree Learner with ID3 Algorithm
2. Text Analyzer with Multinomial Logistic Regression
3. Handwritten Letters Recognition with Neural Network
4. TODO
